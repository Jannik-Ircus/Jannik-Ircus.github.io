								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This was my second ever Game jam back in March 2023.
								We made the game in a group of 4 people in 48 hours completely in Unity.
								The theme for the Game jam was 'Tick. tick... Boom! '.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this game you are in a small level with enemies spawning in waves.
								There is a timer which goes down, once it reaches zero you lose.
								When you shoot enemies you gain a few extra seconds, when enemies come near you they explode and you lose a few seconds.
								You can also spend a few seconds to purchase upgrades for yourself, making time the most important and only ressource.
							</p>
							<p>
								This game actually won Best Game against 6 competitors.
								It works as intented and has an actuall challenge and even a scoreboard.
								The style is similar to my first Game jam game with a 3D world and 2D sprites.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								My main responsibility this time was programming.
								I progammed the shooting, the enemy attacks, the complete UI, the scoreboard and the gameflow(that the game actually starts and ends).
								I also made the UI and added small animations, like a reload animation or a small animation when time gets added/removed.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I learned that i actually enjoy programming on various parts of a game and making them come together.
								It was also the first time that i did UI programming and it was nice adding small details, like animations or a red deathscreen.
								This was also the first time i did a scoreboard which saves itself as a file and automatically sorts itself.
							</p>
							<p>
								All in all this was a really fun project.
								The shorter time and smaller team was nice and it never fellt like a chore to do anything.
								The team in general was really cool with some people from the other Game jam, it showed how important a good team chemistry really is.

								The game can currently be played at <a href="https://mertyn.itch.io/blast-survive-repeat"> itch.io</a>.
