								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>My internship at Wicked Games AG began on 23.10.2023 and ended on 26.04.2024.
								Wicked Games Ag is a Swiss company founded by Karstem Mickulcak with Spherix being their first game.
								The commpany had around 20 employees from all around the world. During work we always communicated in english.
								It seems that they discontinued development on Spherix a few months after I left.
							</p>
							<p>Spherix is a creature collection game with real-time action combat similar to League of Legends. You could capture Spherix, battle, evolve and customize them.
								It is a multiplayer open world with different kind of quests, events and dungeons. It is made in Unreal Engine 5.
							</p>
							<p>
								The Spherix themself are creatures, small or big, with different elements. They are designed to look animalistic, similar to Pokemon.
							</p>
							<p>
								An official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657670/Spherix/">Steam page</a> was published at the start of 2024.
							</p>

								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								During my 6 month internship I had many different tasks, starting with the whole intruduction process and getting used to the workflow.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of my main tasks was always bugfixing. Using a simplified ticket system I was assigned different bugs and fixed them on a seperate version controll branch.
								After they got approved, they got merged to the main branch.
							</p>
							<p>
								Outside of bugfixing I also worked on performance and file size. I used Unreals features for Chunks and Labels to reduce file size for multiple compiled gamefiles.
								To help with performance I worked on several different parts of the game, including texture streaming, nanite optimization and rendering.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also created a few custom Unreal Engine components, like a custom audio brush, which lets you create custom shapes and play audio in them.
							</p>
							<p>
								One of the two main features I worked where teleporters. Working together with a small team consisting of 2 artists and a game designer, we had meetings on how to approach the design and later implemented them.
								my task was creating an interactable teleporter which teleports the player with a small cutscene to a different teleporter. 
								For this feature, I created a small system for cutscenes and used it to make multiple animation sequences with different events.
								One of the main challenges was to make this also work in multiplayer, so I had to implement logic for networking.
							</p>
							<p>
								The other big feature I worked on was Spherix AI in the open world. Together with my team lead we reused a already implemented goal-oriented-action-planning system to controll the Sperix.
								This was the first time I got in contact with this system, which I later used for my bachelor thesis(I didnt use the actual system, but after working with it, I desiced to base my thesis around this topic).
							</p>
							<p>
								I also worked, together with my team lead, on the Spherix website, which used Directus to create a content-heavy website with easy adjustable content. For that  I worked with JavaScript, HTML and Astro Directus.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some smaller tasks I did where: creating a lot of documentation for the features I did and for some I just worked with, using color.io to make a better workflow for the artists, being part of daily meetings and stand ups, researching and reaching out to font-service providers,
								creating options for the options menu, creating a small app using .Net to download files from a cloud with a single button or just generally helping out the team with their problems, just like they helped me out.
							</p>

								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I have learned a lot of things during my time at Wicked Games Ag.
							</p>
							<p>
								First and most important I learned to work in a normal work environment where I am expected to work for 8 hours a day with sometimes even overtime.
								Structuring my time around that and learning to efficently work was a played a big part at my internship.
							</p>
							<p>
								Of course I also learned a lot about Unreal Engine and other programms and general systems. Before I started working here I never touched Unreal before and now, after I am done I feel comfortable to keep working with Unreal Engine projects.
								It is hard to describe just how much I learned during this internship, but it was the biggest learnign experience I ever had, so far.
							</p>
							<p>
								Also working in a big team, where I sometimes have to go to people directly and ask for their help or asking artists for assets, helped me learn to better work in a team.
								It was also a nice experience to work with so many people from all around the world and learn stuff about their culture or their lifes.
								Working on this project was really fun and it showed me how cool it is to work on games, even in a work environment.
