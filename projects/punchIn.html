								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								We had to create a complete game for a module of my studies, which I created in 5 weeks.
								It was made completely in Unity and most models in blender.
								Everything except the maincharacter model, the human animations, the music and soundeffects were made by me.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game itself is about a guy, who punches other guys.
								It has a small story, but it is rather unimportant.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can control your character with a controller or mouse & keyboard and let him move, sprint, look on to enemys and punch.
								There are 2 different punches, one light, which can be pressed up to 3 times for different follow ups and one heavy punch, which can be charged for more damage.
								<br>The enemys use the same model and animations as the maincharacter, because that was the easiest to implement.
							</p>
							
							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Of course in this project, everything was my responsibilty.
								I am quite happy with the endproduct, especially since this was my first big project completely alone.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I don't think there was a single project where I learned as much, as in this one.
								Not only the structuring and managing of this project, but also the whole workflow which comes with working alone.	
							</p>
							<p>
								In this project I also learned, that I really like programming stuff similar to this.
								From the easy combat system, to the save system or even the aiming at enemies with the camera were all new things, I really liked doing.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also learned, that schedules rarely work, when you never did anything like this.
								This was obvious, when I had like 3 days for all the graphics, which I have actually planned to take about 2 weeks.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>External links</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The game is available to download at <a href="https://ircus.itch.io/punchin">itch.io</a>, but the site itself is not really good designed.
