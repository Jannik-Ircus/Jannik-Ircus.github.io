								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This was my first ever Game jam back in August 2022.
								We made the game in a group of 6 people in 72 hours completely in Unity.
								The theme for the Game jam was 'evolution'.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the game the player starts in a cave and gets the task to collect food for the entity.
								When the player leaves the cave, he is in a small world filled with animals and people.
								You can shoot them and they drop food.
								Once you gathered enough food you can bring it to the entity.
								The entity will evolve and order you to bring more food.
								Outside you notice that the world also evolved.
								It seems almost dead, with less animals and a dark atmosphere.
								Again gather food, bring it to the entity and it evolves.
							</p>
							<p>
								The world itself is 3D and all the creatures are 2D sprites, giving it a Doom-like look.
								Sadly the game itself was never completely finished and tested for bugs.
								So in the end the game never really had a challenge.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								For the most part i was responsible for the environment.
								Someone else made most of the 3D models and i placed them in the world.
								The terrain for the world was created by me.
								All 3 stages of the world were created by me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also helped our programmers in various ways, since they were not really experienced in Unity, but they wanted to take this as a opportunity to learn.
								On the last day I also spent some time fixing some of the scripts who where not working correctly.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								For the first time i made an environment completely by myself, except of course the 3D assets.
								Since it was also my first Game jam I learned just how long even small ideas can take.
								So one of the biggest things i learned was the estimation of time for a small project.
