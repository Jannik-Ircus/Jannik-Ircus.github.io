								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This Game jam was in July 2023.
								We made the game in a group of 5 people in 7 days completely in Unity.
								The theme for the Game jam was '90s Arcade'.
								The game needed to be playable in the web.
							</p>
							<p>
								In this game you play a robot who can shoot, jump and transform into a fast car.
								Your goal is to move as far to the right as possible in an infinite generating level.
								On the way you encounter several enemies who will shoot in a bullet-hell-like pattern.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game itself is entirely 2D.
								One of the main eyecatchers is the arcade in which the game plays.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								My main responsibiliy was the movement.
								The character can move left and right, jump and aim in 8 directions and crouch.
								Also the shooting and the collision of bullets was my responsibility just like the animations of the robots.
								I also did some of the general gameflow.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This game had one big problem.
								It was too big, we had too many ideas and that brought many problems along with it.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since this was the first time we used WebGl, so the game is playable in a browser, I made some mistakes.
								I learned that browsers have different framerate caps and I was not able to limit the framerate in our game correctly in time.
								This sadly led to the movement being different on different browsers, which of course ruined some of the game.
							</p>
							<P>
								With the 7 days of time we thought, that we can make a slightly bigger game than last time.
								We were wrong, the 7 days make it feel like you have both too much time and too little, at least for me.
							</P>
							<p>
								I still learned some things about 2D movement, general collisions and WebGl when making this game.
								So as long as you learn something its not all bad.

								<h3>External links</h3>
