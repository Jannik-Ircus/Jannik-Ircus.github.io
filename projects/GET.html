								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>GET is a game that was developed from August 24th 2025 to August 31st 2025. 
								We where a 4 person team with me as the only programmer. 
								The theme for the gamejam was "Risk It for the Biscuit".
								We sadly didn't get enough reviews to be considered eligible for the official voting, but the game is still complete and solid.
							</p>
							<p>In GET you play a burglar breaking into a house and trying to steal as much valuables as possible without getting caught by the homeowner.
							You can sneak and quietly open containers and drawers or sprint, quickly open containers and evade the homeowner.
							</p>
							<p>
								The game was made in Unity.
							</p>

							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								As the only programmer I did all the programming, general setup for the project and more.
							</p>
							<p>
								My main focus points where the movement, the interaction, the gameloop and the enemy AI.
								Other things like UI, scores, level generating or smaller stuff was also handled by me.
							</p>
							<p>
								The movement uses a simple Character Controller with slight adjustments.
							</p>
							<p>
								The interaction system was made in a way to handle both a instant input or a hold input, where the user holds down the button to perform a slightly different input.
								Depending on the fast or quick input, most interactions in game have different logic, like drawers opening fast and making noise, alerting the homeowner, or drawers opening slowly and quietly.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the enemy AI of the homeowner I used a simple Behaviour Tree setup where the homeowner reacts to loud noises, wanders through the house or pursues the player.
							</p>

							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								During this gamejam I learned to work in a gamejam project as the only programmer and how to communicate with my teammates in this project.
								I sometimes had to give explicit instructions or requirements for the artists in order for the assets to work correctly.
							</p>
							<p>
								I also learned how to structure a project and that it is a good thing to have a priority list.
								We had the movement done first, with the interaction system second.
								This way I could always easily test other new systems, since the core functions where already there.
