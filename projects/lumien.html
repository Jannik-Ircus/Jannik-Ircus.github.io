								<h3>Summary of the project</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Lumien is a fast-paced third-person platformer in which you explore the ruins of an ancient civilization and breathe life back into it. On your way past the various defenses, you'll be helped by the Orbs, fueled by the mysterious powers of the civilization.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lumien was created as part of a module series in 2 semester. More than 60 students were split into different teams with corresponding team leaders, who were also students.
								The teams were gamedesign, project management, eventmanagement, art, tech and engine, each with their own responsibilities.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>My responsibilities</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I was part of the engine team, that means that I mostly used Unity while working on this project.
								My main task was importing animations, animation blending and making scripts, that the tech team can use to easily play the animations.
								I also had the honor of importing a lot of the models and textures from art.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this project I also worked with the animation sub-team of the art team.
								They gave me a model with different single animations and I imported them and created the animation trees in Unity.
							</p>
							<p>
								In the end I also started with procedural animations, like moving the head of enemys to always look at the player or placing the feet of the player correctly according to the ground.
								Sadly most of the procedural animation didnt make it in the final game.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>What I learned</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								This was by far the biggest project I worked on so far.
								So my main takeaway is the teamwork, which I learned can be difficult with so many people.
								I learned how hard normal communication can be and how many problems can happen, when not properly communicated.
								But also how much fun it can be to work on something you like with many different and awesome people.
							</p>
							<p>
								While doing all the animation stuff I discovered my interest in procedural animations.
								Working in Unity and doing all that stuff was something I could also see myself doing in the future.
								I also improved in different things in Unity, but thats mostly many different small or personal QOL stuff.
							</p>
							<header class="major">
								<h3>External links</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The game can currently be played at <a href="https://games-studieren.itch.io/lumien"> itch.io</a> and will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2170230/Lumien/">Steam</a> probably later this year.
								<br>It was created as a module series which is also known as <a href="https://games-studieren.hs-mittweida.de/beta/">Beta</a>.
